# VMware Horizon Cloud on Azure WVD Deployment Guide

This document is intended to provide guidance and design considerations when deploying Horizon on Azure using Windows 10 Multisession (EVD).

The main deployment guide is [HCoA-DeploymentGuide.md](https://github.com/njsee/HCoA/blob/master/HCoA-DeploymentGuide.md)

I have also uploaded .Docx and PDF versions of this guide.

Here is where you can find the solution in the Azure market place:
